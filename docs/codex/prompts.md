# 👉 Next Step

If you want, I can:

### ✔ generate the `codex_architect.yaml` that references all five documents  
### ✔ create a unified folder structure for you  
### ✔ once file-editing tools are enabled, automatically write these files into your project  

Would you like me to generate the `codex_architect.yaml` next?
