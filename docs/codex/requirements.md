# Requirements

This document describes *what the system must do*.  
Codex uses these requirements as the functional blueprint for generating code.

## 1. Purpose
Clearly define the features, behaviors, and capabilities the system must provide.

## 2. User Stories
- As a user, I want…
- As an administrator, I need…
- As the system, I must…

## 3. Functional Requirements
Describe each feature in detail:
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Behavior
- Preconditions
- Postconditions

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
Define conditions that must be met:
- The feature works when X.
- The system must reject Y.
- Edge case: Z.

## 5. Edge Cases
List all known edge cases so Codex can implement handling.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance
- Reliability
- Accessibility
- UX expectations
